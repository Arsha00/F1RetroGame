- By: Arian Sjöström Shaafi

Version 1 - Published 2025-10-01:

This is the first version of the Formula 1 Retro Game that I´m Developing. For now, a small and simple track has been created,
with Formula 1 track insipiartion. DRS status set, alsonside speed and speed limit. Two players available, one for user and one AI player.

The AI player is for now limited in speed, and cannot surpase the user player in speed, if player does not decrease speed. 
The AI is set under track limitation and cannot move beyond it´s given track, and the track line. 

RED-YELLOW-GREEN Lights have been added as a Ready-Set-Go function for game start. Start Line Added aswell. 



##### Program FUnctionality:######

For now both players moves and operates accordingly, game camera works accordingly, all statuses work as planned, and finally the start light with countdown works accordingly.
